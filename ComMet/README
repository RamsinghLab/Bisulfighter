= ComMet: an HMM-based approach to detection of differentially methylated regions

== Required libraries 

    Boost C++ libraries 
    http://www.boost.org/


== Build

    tar xzvf ComMet-xxx.tar.gz
    cd ComMet-xxx
    make

You will find the executable in src directory.


== Usage

For help
    ComMet --help

For test run
    ComMet example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2

For more accurate, but slower DMR detection
    ComMet --dual example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2
    ComMet --threshold -5 example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2
    ComMet --dual --threshold -5 example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2


== Input format

See example/example.in 

Col.| Description
----+--------------------------------------
1   | chromosome name 
2   | 0-based genomic position
3   | number of reads supporting mC in sample1
4   | number of reads not supporting mC in sample1
5   | number of reads supporting mC in sample2
6   | number of reads not supporting mC in sample2

reads supporting mC = C-C matches
reads not supporting mC = otherwise


== Output format

output1 contains information of differential methylation at individual cytosines.
See example/example.out1_

Col.| Description
----+--------------------------------------
1   | chromosome name 
2   | 0-based genomic position
3   | mC ratio in sample1
4   | mC ratio in sample2 
5   | prob. for hypermethylation (UP) in sample1 against sample2
6   | prob. for hypomethylation (DOWN) in sample1 against sample2
7   | prob. for no methylation change (NC) between sample1 and sample2

output2 contains information of detected DMRs. 
See example/example.out2_

Col.| Description
----+--------------------------------------
1   | chromosome name 
2   | 0-based genomic start position
3   | 0-based genomic stop position
4   | direction of differential methylation (UP/DOWN) comparing sample1 to sample2
5   | log-likelihood ratio score 


== Bisulfighter

ComMet was first developed as the DMR detection module in Bisulfighter, 
a software package for mC calling and DMR detection. 
Compatibility between ComMet and the mC calling module in Bisulfighter is 
kept by input-output transformation scripts in util directory.
