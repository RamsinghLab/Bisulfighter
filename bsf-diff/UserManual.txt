bsf-diff user manual

1	Introduction 
bsf-diff is a methylation analysis tool for bisulphite next-generation sequence data. It is used to detect 
 Differentially Methylated Region (DMR) between two samples.  

2	OS requirement 
Linux, Mac OS X (Windows is not available, because rpy cannot be installed on it) 

3	Installation
 3.1	Prerequisite 
 The following softwares are required for bsf_diff execution. Please install them.

  3.1.1	Python (2.4 or higher) 
  URL) http://www.python.org/ 
  By default, python interpreter is available in almost all linux or mac os. If this is not the case, 
  follow the installation instruction on the python web page. 

  3.1.2	R (2.0.0 or higher) 
  URL) http://www.r-project.org/ 
  R package could be available by package management software (apt-get for ubuntu, yum for
centos). 
  If not available, follow the installation instruction on the python web page.
  http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html 

  3.1.3	locfit 
  URL) http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/project/locfit/index.html 
  R library for Local Regression and Likelihood (used for smoothing in bsf-diff). 
  In R console, execute the following command to install. 
  > install.packages("locfit") 

  3.1.4	rpy (1.0.*) 
  URL) http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy.html 
  R-wrapper for python. 
  Download rpy zip file, and unzip it, cd into it. Execute the following command to install. 
  $ python setup.py install 

 3.2	Install 
 As provided as python scripts, no installation procedure is required for bsf-diff itself. 

4	Usage 
Command line usage is as follows.  

 bsf_diff.py [options] sample1_rep1[,sample1_rep2,...] sample2_rep1[,sample2_rep2,...] [sampleN_rep1,sampleN_rep2]
  
Main arguments are input data file name. Input data file format is described in section 5. If multiple 
replicates exist for one sample, these replicate file names must be concatenated by a comma (ex: 
sample_rep1,sample_rep2). If more than two samples are provided, all pairs between these samples will 
be analyzed. 
 
Options are as follows. 
  
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --smooth          smooth methylation rate data before DMR detection
                        [default: False]
  --smooth-window=<Integer>
                        width of smoothing window [default: 100]
  -t <BED file name>, --target=<BED file name>
                        target region in BED4 format. if this option is on,
                        only target region is checked to be DMR or not
  --gtf=<GTF file name>
                        genes in GTF (Gene Transfer Format). tell bsf_diff to
                        check DMRs are associated with these genes
  --assoc-dist=<[+-]?Integer>
                        max DMR association distance for upstream and/or
                        downstream of gene. exp) +3000
  -p <Float>            p-value threshold for chi-square test and t-test
                        [default: 0.0001]
  -c <Integer>, --coverage=<Integer>
                        minimum coverage at mC position in DMR [default: 5]
  --filter=CG[, CHG[,CHH]
                        mC context to be called DMR. [default: CG]
  -l String[,String], --label=String[,String]
                        camma-separated label strings for sample name in DMR
                        output file [default: Sample1,Sample2]
  --neighbor-dist=<Integer>
                        max distance between neighboring mC positions in DMR
                        [default: 100]
  -m <Integer>, --multi-thread=<Integer>
                        number of threads [default: 1]
  --c-samples=<Integer>
                        minimum number of mCs for DMR [default: 5]
  --min-width=<Integer>
                        minimum width of DMR [default: 100] 

5	Input file 
A sample file or replicate file contains methylation state information. One line for one mC position. 
Lines must be sorted by chromosome name and position. Each line has the following columns. 
 
6	Output files
 6.1	DMR output 
 File name is "gene diff-dmr-$i-$j.txt". $i is i-th sample name, $j is j-th sample name. 
 Each line stands for a DMR detected, and has the following columns. 
 
 6.2	Associated genes 
 Output only when --gtf option is provided. 
 File name is "gene diff-gene-$i-$j.txt". $i is i-th sample name, $j is j-th sample name. 
 Each line stands for a gene associated with detected DMRs, and has the following columns. 
 
7	Example 
bsf-diff package include test data in test_data directory. You can try the command below in test_data 
directory.
